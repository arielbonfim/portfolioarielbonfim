<br/><br/>
It’s an honor to share this selection of videos I’ve edited throughout my career. Here you’ll find the pieces that I believe best represent my skills and my style. I hope you enjoy watching them as much as I enjoyed creating them.
<br/><br/>

## About Me

My name is Ariel Leon Socio Bonfim, I’m 31 years old, and I live in Teresópolis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I’ve always loved technology, and I’ve worked with audiovisual since I was a teenager. But over the last decade, I studied and worked in completely different fields — from agriculture and engineering to telecommunications and urban transportation — until I finally reconnected with content creation in 2022, when I started working with Diolinux.

My diverse background gave me a broader understanding of the world and of the many industries that keep the economy moving. This variety of experiences allows me to understand and communicate with a wide range of people from different social and professional backgrounds. I truly believe I’m a valuable addition to any content production or marketing team, contributing in everything from strategy, planning, and scriptwriting to editing, design, and review.
<br/><br/>

## Diolinux

I started working with Diolinux in 2022, originally as a writer. But from the very beginning, I felt drawn to video editing — something I already had a bit of experience with. After studying, training, and upgrading my equipment, I officially became the lead editor for the Diolinux Labs channel in January 2025.

Since then, I’ve been editing between one and three videos per week. Thanks to continuous feedback and guidance from Dionatan Simioni (Dio), the founder and leader of Diolinux, I’ve learned and improved immensely.

Diolinux is the biggest reference for Linux-oriented and open-source technology communication in Brazil. Today, besides having written more than 2,000 articles for the blog, I’ve also edited over 100 videos for Diolinux Labs.
<br/><br/>

### Unboxing & Product Reviews

We work with two YouTube channels: Diolinux and Diolinux Labs. The main channel is more focused, covering only the most important concepts and news in the Linux and open-source ecosystem. On Diolinux Labs — where I’m the lead editor — the content is more open, featuring three hosts and occasional guests. One of the Labs formats is unboxing and product reviews.
<br/><br/>

#### Geniodesk Chair Review

{{< youtube diDda2bdC5Y >}}
<br/>
In this video, Dio compares two ergonomic chairs sent by Geniodesk, a Brazilian brand known for adjustable-height desks and now expanding into seating.

In the edit, I highlighted the differences and similarities between the mid-range and premium models, playing with the viewer’s expectations as they try to guess what the price difference might be. I also emphasized how easy — and even fun — the assembly experience is, finishing with the ergonomic and durability benefits of the premium model.
<br/><br/>

#### Logitech Keyboard Review

{{< youtube wJLAOCyLC4k >}}
<br/>
Dio loves keyboards, and in this video he reviews a new Logitech model he bought, clearly presenting its pros and cons and who the product is best for.
<br/><br/>

### Explaining Internet Concepts

Our sponsor Hostinger supports a monthly series where we explain internet and infrastructure concepts in simple, visual ways.
What is DDoS?

{{< youtube UC7GJbid3bI >}}
<br/>
In this video, Raul explains what DDoS attacks are — especially relevant in 2025, a year marked by some of the most severe attacks ever recorded. For the edit, I wanted a playful and visual way to illustrate the attack mechanics, so I used animations inspired by Pokémon games’ battle sequences.
<br/><br/>

### News Editing

Our weekly tech, Linux, and open-source news show, Diolinux News, is presented by Raul.
<br/><br/>

#### Diolinux News

{{< youtube c-eZlLEYpxQ >}}
<br/>
He sends me his recording shortly before publication, so this is a fast-turnaround edit with simple and direct motion graphics that often reference the Diolinux website and link back to articles I wrote myself.
<br/><br/>

### App Showcase

This series highlights Linux distros and software, focusing on features and technical details with minimal opinion.
<br/><br/>

#### Tiger OS Review

{{< youtube adf9c2lYrjs >}}
<br/>
The community really wanted this video, as Tiger OS is maintained by one of our subscribers. It was a long video I had to edit quickly to meet our weekly schedule, while still delivering the expected quality.
<br/><br/>

#### WebApps Generator

{{< youtube LiF7aPxgrnI >}}
<br/>
In this video, Raul showcases an app that generates webapps from any website, aligning visually with the GNOME design language. Another fast edit but with attention to clarity and pacing.
<br/><br/>

### Tutorials

Linux is much easier today, but it can still be deep for advanced users. That’s why we make detailed technical tutorials.
Debian Workstation Setup

{{< youtube gXkN1FOCMSY >}}
<br/>
In this video, Eddie walks through how he configures Debian for work. My goal in the edit was to present every step of a complex process clearly, adding a few comedic moments and references to make the content more enjoyable.
<br/><br/>

## Renata Rosa Photography

Renata is a corporate photographer and filmmaker. For her, I produce and edit videos, write scripts, and create the design and copy for visual pieces.
<br/><br/>

### Scriptwriting, AI Voiceovers & Editing

Rontec is a vehicle customization company producing police units, ambulances, rescue trucks, and other specialized vehicles. Their audience includes city governments, state agencies, and private companies needing technical fleets.

For them, I create informative Instagram videos narrated with AI, handling everything from script to final edit.
<br/><br/>

#### K-9 Police Vehicle

{{< youtube VrRCxXzhTh8 >}}
<br/>
This video introduces the K-9 vehicle used for canine operations. I open by referencing the classic movie K-9 to grab attention, then present the real-world applications of the vehicle and the importance of trained dogs in police work. The video ends highlighting Rontec as a leader in vehicle customization.
<br/><br/>

#### Med Truck — Aerial Rescue Training Vehicle

{{< youtube 6b-TpV2cLok >}}
<br/>
This piece follows a trending “news-style” format popular in Brazil, mixing national pride, public safety, and technological development. It presents the Med Truck, the first aerial rescue-training truck of its kind in Brazil. Aviation has strong cultural appeal here, especially with Santos Dumont as an iconic figure.
<br/><br/>

### Motion Design — Concept, Script, Voiceover, and Animation
<br/>

#### Cargoland — Logistics Motion Video

{{< youtube 2hggnKutmZ4 >}}
<br/>

I created this motion piece from scratch — script, production, AI narration, and animation — for Cargoland, a logistics company. The video explains the importance of smart international logistics, highlights the brand’s advantages, walks viewers through the quotation process, and ends with a clear call to action. My favorite part is the cargo ship with real-time tracking.
<br/><br/>

#### Medic Me — Product Overview

{{< youtube gPwFko7IDoo >}}
<br/>
Renata sent the footage, and I handled everything else: editing, color correction, animation, and the final logo motion.
<br/><br/>

#### Honda Consortium — Internal Presentation Motion

{{< youtube yDXQIkNKpm4 >}}
<br/>
For this motion piece, I received only the audio and created the entire visual side, including design and animation. It’s an internal presentation outlining the company’s market plan for the next year. My favorite element is the animated map — I used QGIS and Google Maps to generate the base images.
<br/><br/>

### Real-Time Event Coverage
<br/>

#### Zen Head — Event Screens

{{< youtube PV7VTFyyn1A >}}
<br/>

A fast motion I created to be displayed on big screens during an event, using footage captured on site. The goal was to promote Zen Head, a new franchise of hair-care stations inspired by the calming aesthetic of popular East Asian videos. I followed the client’s creative direction and built a light narrative around it.
<br/><br/>

#### Tunibra — Honda Motorcycle Event
{{< youtube svf3hopRi_w >}}
<br/>

This video was edited for Tunibra, the company organizing the reception for a Honda motorcycle race event.
<br/><br/>

## Marina Godward (Vlogs)

I help Marina maintain consistency on her YouTube channel. She sends me the footage organized in sequence, and I handle the editing and soundtrack selection.
